# Data Alchemist ðŸ§ª
Data Alchemist is a React app for managing, validating, and prioritizing datasets (Clients, Workers, Tasks) in optimization and scheduling. It offers an easy-to-use interface for uploading data, defining rules, and setting priorities.

## Key Features
Data Handling: Upload CSV/XLSX files, view and edit data in an interactive grid with filtering and sorting.

Validation: Automated checks for data integrity within datasets and across them. Errors are highlighted for quick fixes.

Rule Creation: Define rules like co-run tasks, slot restrictions, load limits, phase windows, pattern matching, and precedence orders.

Prioritization: Adjust weights for client priority, fairness, fulfillment, idle time, and overload avoidance. Apply preset profiles for quick setup.

Export: Download all data (Clients, Workers, Tasks, Rules, Weights) as a single ZIP file.
